📂 Project Structure

MainActivity.java → App logic (button handling, arithmetic, display updates)
content_main.xml → Calculator layout (buttons + result screen)
res/values/colors.xml → Custom button colors for numbers, operators, and clear button

📖 Learning Highlights
Implemented onClick listeners via XML (android:onClick) and handled them in MainActivity.
Practiced string parsing and float calculations in Java.
Improved UI skills with ConstraintLayout and GridLayout.

🔮 Future Improvements
Support for parentheses () and advanced operations (%, √, ^).
Memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC).
Dark/Light mode support.
Better error handling (e.g., division by zero).
